# Fintech_Insight_BotðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Fintech Insight Bot! This application leverages the power of Generative AI and cutting-edge NLP techniques to provide real-time financial insights. By using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, weâ€™ve designed a bot that not only retrieves relevant data but also generates insightful, timely responses. Whether youâ€™re looking for financial article summaries, stock market information, or intelligent Q&A about financial news, this bot has you covered.

With the integration of Pinecone Vector Database, we ensure efficient and accurate information retrieval, helping you make well-informed financial decisions.
